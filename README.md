Hi! My name is Brandon and I’m currently a Junior at the University of Minnesota studying Computer Science. Growing up, I always knew that engineering was my passion so I participated in lots of different extracurriculars like Robotics, Science Olympiad, Model Rocketry, and volunteering at the Science Museum of Minnesota. 

My newfound passion is in software development, where I like to spend time creating personal projects. My personal favorite projects are Annote, a live-transcription digital notebook app, and my TFT Simulator and Calculator, which replicates Riot Games' Teamfight Tactics in-game shop system and uses hypergeometric distribution to calculate the percentage of hitting a specific unit. I’m most comfortable using Python, Java, SQL, and React.
