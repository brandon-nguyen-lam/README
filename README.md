Hi! My name is Brandon and I’m currently a Junior at the University of Minnesota studying Computer Science. Growing up, I always knew that engineering was my passion so I participated in lots of different extracurriculars like Robotics, Science Olympiad, Model Rocketry, and volunteering at the Science Museum of Minnesota. 

My newfound passion is in software development, where I like to spend time on my personal projects. My personal favorite projects are Annote, a live-transcription digital notebook app, and my TFT Simulator and Calculator, that calculates the odds of hitting specific units in Riot Games, Teamfight Tactics. I’m most comfortable using Python, Java, SQL, and React.
